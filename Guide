# Book Management System Project Guide

## Project Proposal Phase

### Project Definition
- **Objective**: To create a microservice-based book management system with user management, book management, borrowing, search and recommendation, and admin functionalities.
- **Tech Stack**: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Docker, Kubernetes, ELK Stack, Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Security.

### Requirements Analysis
- Collect and analyze user requirements.
- Define functional and non-functional requirements (such as performance, security, scalability).

### Project Planning
- Define project milestones and timelines.
- Allocate resources and determine team structure.

### Risk Assessment
- Identify potential risks and challenges.
- Develop mitigation strategies.

## Initialization Phase

### Setting Up Project Repository
- Create a repository on GitHub or a similar platform.
- Set up a branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow).

### Project Skeleton Setup
- Create a basic template and common libraries for microservices.
- Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline.

### Environment Setup
- Set up development, testing, and production environments.
- Configure databases, message queues, and other infrastructures.

## Development Phase

### Microservices Development
- Develop each microservice step by step according to the requirements analysis.
- Implement core functionalities like user management, book management, borrowing, etc.

### Configuration Management and Logging System Integration
- Integrate Spring Cloud Config for configuration management.
- Integrate ELK Stack for logging management.

### Service Discovery and API Gateway Integration
- Integrate Eureka for service discovery.
- Integrate Spring Cloud Gateway as the API gateway.

### Security and Authentication
- Implement security and authentication using Spring Security.

### Search and Recommendation System Development
- Integrate Elasticsearch for efficient search.
- Develop a recommendation system based on user data.

### Frontend Development
- Develop the user interface using Thymeleaf or React.

## Testing Phase

### Unit Testing and Integration Testing
- Perform unit testing for each microservice.
- Conduct integration testing between services.

### Performance Testing
- Conduct load testing and stress testing.

### Security Testing
- Perform security vulnerability scans and penetration testing.

## Deployment and Maintenance Phase

### Containerization and Cloud Deployment
- Containerize microservices using Docker.
- Use Kubernetes for container orchestration and cloud deployment.

### Monitoring and Logging
- Set up a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus).
- Configure log collection and analysis.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment
- Refine the CI/CD process for continuous integration and automatic deployment.

## Completion and Maintenance Phase

### Project Documentation
- Complete project documentation, including design documents, user manuals, and API documentation.

### User Training and Feedback
- Conduct system training for users.
- Collect user feedback for iterative improvements.

### Maintenance and Support
- Regularly update and maintain the system.
- Provide necessary technical support.
