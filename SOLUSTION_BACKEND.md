# Book Management System Backend Solution

## Architecture Overview

### Microservices Design
- **User Service**: Manages user registration, login, and user profile management.
- **Book Service**: Handles the addition, deletion, updating, and querying of books.
- **Borrowing Service**: Manages the borrowing and returning process of books.
- **Search and Recommendation Service**: Provides search functionality and behavior-based recommendations to users.

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ/Kafka (for asynchronous inter-service communication)
- **Data Consistency**: Saga Pattern or Event-Driven Architecture
- **Service Registry and Discovery**: Eureka/Consul
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway/Zuul
- **Security**: Spring Security + JWT/OAuth
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## Detailed Service Design

### User Service
- **Functionality**: User registration, login, permission management, and user information update.
- **Database Design**:
  - User Table: Stores user information.
  - Permission Table: Stores permission-related data.
- **Security**: Implemented using Spring Security and JWT for authentication and authorization.

### Book Service
- **Functionality**: Adding, deleting, updating, and querying books.
- **Database Design**:
  - Book Table: Stores book information.
  - Category Table: Stores book category information.
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs providing CRUD operations.

### Borrowing Service
- **Functionality**: Manages the borrowing and return of books.
- **Database Design**:
  - Borrowing Records Table: Stores information on users' borrowings.
- **Data Consistency**: Uses Saga Pattern for cross-service transactions handling.

### Search and Recommendation Service
- **Functionality**: Provides search capabilities and recommendations based on user behavior.
- **Technology**: Elasticsearch for full-text search, machine learning algorithms for recommendations.

### Communication and Data Consistency
- **Inter-Service Communication**: Synchronous communication via REST APIs, asynchronous communication via message queues.
- **Data Consistency**: Choose between Saga Pattern or Event-Driven Architecture based on business needs.

## Security and Compliance
- Ensure all data transfer is secured with HTTPS.
- Implement proper user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Comply with relevant data protection regulations.

## Logging and Monitoring
- Use ELK Stack for logging collection and analysis.
- Set up Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring.

## Deployment and Maintenance
- Containerize services using Docker.
- Manage and orchestrate containers using Kubernetes.
